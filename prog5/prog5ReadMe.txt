  This is file prog5.README in the directory 

          ~csi402/public/prog5

You should also take a careful look at the following three 
additional files in this directory. 

  (1) submission_info.txt: This file explains how you should use
      the turnin-csi402 program to submit your source files
      and makefile. 

      ---------------------------------------------------------
      IMPORTANT!!  The submission_info.txt file also contains 
      specifications for your makefile. These specifications
      ARE DIFFERENT from those used in previous projects. So,
      please read the specifications carefully.
      ---------------------------------------------------------

  (2) parta_sample_info: This file provides information about some sample 
      inputs and outputs for Part (a). 

  (3) partb_sample_info: This file gives information about some sample 
      inputs and outputs for Part (b).

Suggested File Naming Convention:
---------------------------------

  Since the program has two parts, you are strongly advised
to use the following naming convention for the source files for
the two parts.

  (a) For all source files that belong to Part (a), use the 
      prefix "p5a_". (Thus, you may have files such as 
      "p5a_constants.h", "p5a_struct_def.h", "p5a_main.c",
      "p5a_functions.c", etc.)

  (b) Similarly, for all source files that belong to Part (b), use the 
      prefix "p5b_".
