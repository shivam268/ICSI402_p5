            CSI 402 -- Notes about Programming Assignment V
            ================================================

  Please read the information included in this file carefully and
follow the directions. Program submissions not conforming to the 
directions specified below are likely to lose almost all of 
the credit.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT!!

  (a) Recall that this assignment is due by 11 PM on Monday, 
      May 6, 2013 and that there is NO (two-day) grace period for this
      assignment.

  (b) Even though there are two parts in this assignment, all the source
      files for both parts and the makefile MUST BE SUBMITTED TOGETHER 
      using the turnin-csi402 Unix command. 

  (c) Please read the specifications for your makefile (given below) 
      carefully.
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Specifications for the makefile:
-------------------------------

   Even though this program has two parts, you must have only
ONE makefile which MUST have the name "makefile" (without the
double quotes). 

  The makefile MUST have two targets called all and clean.
(The names "all" and "clean"  MUST NOT be changed.)  

  The first target (all) should be the default. That is, when
we run make WITHOUT specifying a target, the makefile should
produce the following three executables:  p5a, p5b_server 
and p5b_client.  (Recall that p5b_server and p5b_client 
are respectively the executable versions of the server and 
client programs for Part (b).)

  When we run make with clean as the target, it should delete
all the ".o" files and the file named core (if any).

Information Concerning Electronic Submission:
---------------------------------------------

VERY IMPORTANT NOTES: 
---------------------

  (0) Make sure that at the top of each of your header files, 
      C source files and makefile, your first and last name and 
      your Unix login id are included as comments. 

  (1) To submit your files electronically, you must have the files on 
      one of the Unix machines (itsunix.albany.edu) supported by 
      Information Technology Services (ITS) unit of UAlbany. Also, 
      you must be logged on to one of those machines to actually 
      carry out the electronic submission. 

  (2) Make sure that your program compiles and produces correct 
      results on the Unix machines supported by ITS.  Programs that 
      cause compiler or linker errors will NOT receive any credit. 

  (3) Using the turnin-csi402 program as discussed below is the ONLY
      acceptable way of submitting programming assignments in 
      this course.  You should NOT mail the files to the 
      instructor or to the TAs.

  (5) DON'T turn in unnecessary files (e.g. object files with 
      extension ".o" created by compiling C source files, 
      executable files such as "a.out", etc.). 

  Remember that you must submit all the necessary header files (with 
extension ".h"), all the necessary C source files (with 
extension ".c") and the makefile.  To submit these files 
electronically, you would type the following command to the 
(Unix) operating system:

   /usr/local/bin/turnin-csi402 -c csi402  *.c  *.h  makefile

(We are assuming that your working directory at the time when you
issue the above command contains only those header files, the C 
source files and the makefile that you want to submit.)

  After you issue the above command, the system responds with:

    Your files have been submitted to csi402, prog5 for grading.

In the above message, "prog5" refers to the name of the project
that is currently active.  Attempts to submit the program after 
11 PM, Monday, May 6, 2013 will fail.

Additional information about the turnin program: 
------------------------------------------------

 (a) If you use the turnin command above again at a later time
     (before the deadline), then the files submitted previously would be
     replaced by the newly submitted files. (This allows you to resubmit
     a program if the previous submission was erroneous.)

(b) At any time, you can obtain the names of the files that you
     have submitted to the current project using the following command:

         /usr/local/bin/turnin-csi402 -c csi402 -v
