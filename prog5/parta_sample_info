Information about sample inputs for Part (a) of Program V:
----------------------------------------------------------

  There are two sample inputs for Part (a). They are in the
subdirectories a_test1 and a_test2 respectively.

  (a) In the a_test1 subdirectory, the individual files 
      are cons.h, const.h, count.c, count.o and arch1. 
      The file arch1 is the output obtained by running p5a 
      on cons.h, const.h, count.c, and count.o with the 
      "-c" option.

  (b) In the a_test2 subdirectory, the individual files 
      are file1.c, file11.c, j1.c, j1.o and arch2. 
      The file arch2 is the output obtained by running p5a on 
      file1.c, file11.c, j1.c and j1.o with the "-c" option.

-----------------------------------------------------------------
IMPORTANT!!
   Some of the files in the above directories (e.g. the two
archive files arch1 and arch2) are BINARY files. They were
created on itsunix. They may NOT be compatible with other 
machines. 
-----------------------------------------------------------------

Here, we explain how to use the test case in a_test1.  Similar 
comments apply to the test case in a_test2.

  As mentioned above, the directory a_test1 contains the files
are cons.h, const.h, count.c, count.o and arch1. 

  With these files, when you run the command

      p5a  -c  new_arch  cons.h  const.h  count.c  count.o 

the binary file new_arch produced by your program should be
identical to the file arch1. (You should use the "diff" command
to compare the two files.)

  To check whether your program extracts the files correctly from the
archive, you are advised to create a new directory (say, temp) containing
only the executable version (p5a) of your program and the file arch1.
In that directory, when you run the command

      p5a  -x  arch1

your program should create the files cons.h, const.h, count.c and count.o 
in the directory. These newly created files should be identical to
the respective files cons.h, const.h,  count.c and count.o 
in the other directory.  (Again, you should use "diff" to make sure 
that there are no differences between the corresponding files.)
